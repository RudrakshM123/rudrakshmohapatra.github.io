							<p><strong>Climate Ambassador | RISE Global Winner | Freshman at Stanford University</strong><br />
								In addition, I am a member of the New York Academy of Sciences, published researcher, and environmental enthusiast. <br/> 
								My research experience is in the fields of computer science and environmental systems. I mainly focus on using geospatial tools such as Geographic 
								Information System and Remote Sensing data, and combine them with machine learning to solve problems pertaining to natural disasters, climate change, 
								soil erosion and more.</p>

									<h2>Research Publications</h2>
									<p>My research experience mainly lies in the fields of computer science and environmental systems. Some of my past research work include: <br><br>
										<strong>2022:</strong> Calculated the soil erosion of a vulnerable river basin in central India. Using satellite data and geospatial software, the annual rate at which the topsoil was being eroded was computed. 
										The work involved using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and calcualting its several variables like crop-management, soil erodibility, rainfall-runoff and more. This work had been ongoing for 2 years and 
										was finally published in <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40808-022-01388-5">Springer Nature: Modelling and Earth Systems Sciences</a></strong><br><br>
										
										<strong>2021:</strong> Assesed how mass-movement disasters like landslides can be predicted using tree-based algorithms and geospatial software. Different metrics of slope, 
										vegetation cover, changes in climate, infrastructure and  more were used to compute the probability of landslides and occuring in the study area. The relative importance of these factors 
										was also established. It has been published in <a href = "https://doi.org/10.55779/ng3163"><strong>Nova Geodesia</strong></a> in 2023<br><br>

										<strong>2020:</strong> Measured the water potential of a semi-arid region in India, and how water resources can be preserved keeping in mind rapid urbanization 
										and its engulfing of natural resources. It has been published in the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3829989"><strong>Social Science Research Network</strong></a>

									<h2>Conferences and Presentations</h2>
									<p><strong>American Geophysical Union Conference</strong><br>I presented my work on the prediction of mass-movement disasters at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in December 2022. I showcased some of the 
									interesting observations as well as difficulties faced during the development of the algoritm. <br><br>
									<strong>International Geographical Union Conference</strong><br>I showcased some of the progress I had made in my soil erosion research at the International Workshop on Geography and Sustainability in November 2021. This was jointly hosted by the 
									International Geographical Union and the Geographical Society of China<br><br>
									<strong>iGeomatics</strong><br>I won the second best poster presentation award at a national symposium organized by the Indian Society for Remote Sensing and Indian Society of Geomatics. Themed oral and posterpresentations are selected on the basis of a 1,000-word abstract. One of the themes was "Landslides", where I presented my work.<br><br>
									<strong>IRIS National Fair</strong><br>The IRIS National Fair selects the top 100 STEM projectrs by high-school students across India. My work was directly related to the Sendai Disaster Risk Reduction Framework and the United Nations SDG of Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure and the SDG ofSustainable Cities and Communities.<br>I won the RICOH 
									Sustainable Development Award for my work on predicting landslides that would aid in imporoved disaster response and relief measures. </p>
